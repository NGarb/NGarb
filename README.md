### Good day • добрый день • Guten tag 


Welcome to my page ✨ 

I discovered Data Science along with the rest of the world as it was first coming into existence and being defined in 2015. I am initially mostly self-taught, and am super passionate about the _practical_ application of AI into products as well as well-positioned story-telling with data. 

- 👨‍💻 Some of my projects are available at 

- 🤔 Personal blog [https://ngarb.github.io/](https://ngarb.github.io/)

- :dancers: I would love to collaborate on NLP projects or more general open Machine Learning projects
